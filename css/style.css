/* Step 1: Animate the logo with keyframes.  (Here is a keyframes reference.) It should start at a width of 25px and grow to 475px.  It should also start with an opacity of 0 and end with an opacity of 1. The animation should take 5 seconds and only happen when the page is loaded. **You can complete this step later in the process - it won’t affect the larger views.  */

/* Step 6: Identify the proper selector to style ONLY those header elements that are direct children of a card class.  The required styling is the following: 
background: #288088,

20px of padding on the top and the bottom, 
50px border-radius on the top left and right corners.*/
